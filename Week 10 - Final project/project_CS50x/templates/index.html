            <p>Meat, for animal products, is often the most significant part of many people's diets and are often the centrepiece in any given meal.</p>
            <p>What makes meats different from other food types is that they are the primary source of protein in most diets as they are known as a complete protein (or ideal or high-quality protein),
                meaning they contain all nine essential amino acids.</p>

            <h2><i>Why choose?</i></h2>
            <p>There are many different meat options available, so why choose when one can eat whatever's convenient or even eat them all? </p>
            <p>Well, meats are eaten based on different intentions, for example, weight loss or lean muscle growth, developing muscular endurance, bulking, cutting or muscular maintenance.</p>
            <p>Thus, it is important to be selective with your meats to ensure you are consuming the right type of meat suitable for your personal health reasons as well as negating possible negative health effects of the different meats.</p>
