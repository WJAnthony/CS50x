            <h2><i>Proteins & Amino Acids</i></h2>
            <p>Protein is a nutrient our body needs to grow and repair cells, and to perform many other body functions.</p>
            <p>They are made up of building blocks called amino acids and are referred to as the building blocks of life.</p>
            <p>There are 20 different amino acids that link together in different combinations, each having its unique use within the body,
                ranging from building muscle and bone to creating enzymes and hormones.</p>
            <p>Of the 20 amino-acids, the human body is only able to synthesise 11 of them, also known as non-essential amino acids. The other 9,
                known as essential amino acids, cannot be synthesised and thus must be wholly met by our diet for optimal body function.</p>
