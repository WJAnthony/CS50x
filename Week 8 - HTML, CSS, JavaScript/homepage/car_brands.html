            <h1>Car Brands from around the world</h1>
            <p>
                The most famous example of mass scale production and sale of a car was by the Ford Motor Company.
                Henry Ford, founder of the Ford Motor Company, expanded on the concept of mass production using an assembly line and interchangeable parts in 1913 by using a moving assembly line.
                This way, cars moved from one station to another, each station focusing on a specific part of the car, allowing cars to be produced in as little as 15 minutes and requiring less manpower!
                As a result, more than 15 million Model T's were built and sold, paving the way for the mass adoption of cars by the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, there are nearly 400 different car brands/manufacturers from all corners of the world.
                Some are megacoporations within many models and sub-models that appeal to a wide range of customers while some focus on only a few models ensuring quality and uniqueness.
                Some car brands are steep with history, pioneering certain technologies or in motorsports while some are just breaking onto the scene.
            </p>
            <p>
                It would be impossible to cover all the car brands in the world, let alone explain their history, present model range, famous cars, speciality or brand identity.
                Thus this section will only briefly introduce the more well-known car brands you see today grouped by country.
