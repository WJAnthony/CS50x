            <h1>The invention of the automobile</h1>
            <p>
                The invention of the first automobile is not as straightfoward as it seems.
                The first recorded concepts to build an automobile started as early as 1672.
                What followed were many different attempts in building a self-propelled automotive by many different individuals across the world.
                For example, Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot is credited with building the first full-scale, self-propelled mechanical vehicle in about 1769
            </p>
            <p>
                However, the most widely recognised inventor of the first automobile is Carl Benz.
                He developed the first stationary gasoline engine, a one-cylinder two-stroke unit which ran for the first time on New Years Eve 1879.
                The commercial success with this engine allowed him devote more time to creating a lightweight car powered by a gasoline engine, in which the chassis and engine formed a single unit.
            </p>
            <p>
                The car you see above was completed in 1885. Its four-stroke engine was mounted at the back and produced only 0.75hp.
                In 1886, Benz recieved the patent for his “vehicle powered by a gas engine”, marking the birth of the automobile.
